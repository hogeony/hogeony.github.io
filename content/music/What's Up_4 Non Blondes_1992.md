Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath
And I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

And I say, hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
I said, hey, what's going on?
And I say, hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
I said, hey, what's going on?

And I try, oh my God, do I try
I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution

And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath
And I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

And I say, hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
I said, hey, what's going on?
And I say, hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
I said, hey, what's going on?

Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
